## Welcome!

The **Algorithmic Bioinformatics** group at Saarland University is headed by Prof. Sven Rahmann.
It belongs to both the Mathematics and Informatics Faculty ("MI") and the Center for Bioinformatics (ZBI) and is part of Saarland Informatics Campus (SIC).
Our research focuses on method development (algorithms and data structures) for concrete problems that arise in biological data analysis.
We mainly teach in the Bioinformatics degree programs.
