## Target audience (IMPORTANT!)

This course is offered as a **specialized lecture** in the B.Sc. or M.Sc. **Bioinformatics** degrees, for 9 ECTS credits.

## Topics

The following topics will be covered in the course; additional topics may be included, depending on time and current events.

**Probability**

**Statistics**
* descriptive statistics
* moments of random variables (expectation, variance, ...)
* parametric models
* statistical testing (frequentist view)
* statistical testing (Bayesian view)
* parameter estimation: moments, maximum likelihood
* parameter estimation in mixture models: EM algorithm
