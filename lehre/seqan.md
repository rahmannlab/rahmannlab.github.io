# Lecture “Algorithms for Sequence Analysis”
Specialized lecture (Master Bioinformatics), Saarland University

## Summer 2021

Because of the ongoing CoViD-19 pandemic, this lecture and its associated exercises will be online only and follow an inverted classroom structure.
Lecture videos and exercise sheets will be linked on this page.

During contact times, I will discuss key points and difficult aspects of the videos.
Of course, I will also answer questions.
We will discuss the exercises together as a group.
For this to work effectively, it is expected that you have watched the video and prepared questions before joining the online lectures each week!

**Lectures**: asynchronously according to your own schedule, but watch the video before each online lecture!\\
**Online meetings**: TBD\\
**Lecture notes**: [TODO](TODO)\\
**Exams**: 9 ECTS credits. Details TBD.\\
