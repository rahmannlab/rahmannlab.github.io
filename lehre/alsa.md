# Lecture “Algorithms for Sequence Analysis”
Specialized course, M.Sc. Bioinformatics, Saarland University.\\
Elective course, M.Sc. Computer Science, Saarland University.\\

**Prerequisites:** B.Sc. in Bioinformatics or CS, no special requirements.\\
**Credits:** 9 ECTS credits\\
**Required time:** 4V+2Ü (4 hours of lectures, 2 hours of exercises per week)\\
**Registration:** TBD

**Notes:** Summer 2021 is a virtual online semester. Lectures will be delivered via Zoom. to obtain the Zoom link, please register for the course!


## Topics

The following topics will be covered in the course; additional topics may be included, depending on time and current events.

* exact pattern matching algorithms (simple patterns, no index) and their analysis: algorithms based on automata and bit-parallel algorithms
* full-text index data structures (suffix tree, suffix arrays)
* several applications of full-text index data structures to bioinformatics, e.g. repeat discovery
* succinct index data structues (FM index) and algorithms (backward search)
* application: read mapping
* pairwise sequence alignment: algorithms, variations, speed-ups
* multiple sequence alignment: models, hardness, heuristics
* alignment-free methods, *k*-mers, hashing
* several applications of alignment-free methods


## Summer 2021

Because of the ongoing CoViD-19 pandemic, this lecture and its associated exercises will be online only and delivered via Zoom.
Lecture recordings and exercise sheets will be linked on this page.

We will discuss the exercises together as a group.
For this to work effectively, it is expected that you have watched the lectures or recordings and thought about the problems each week!

**Lectures**: Tue 12:30-14:00 and Thu 08:30-10:00 each week\\
**Exercises**: will be discussed during first meeting\\
**Lecture notes**: [TODO](TODO)\\
**Exams**: 9 ECTS credits. Dates and details TBD.\\
There is some general information on exams in German: **[Informationen](/infos/pruefungen)**
