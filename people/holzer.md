Dr Andre Holzer is a passionate scientist and entrepreneur working at the University of Cambridge (UK) and Saarland University (DE). 

He completed a BSc degree in Molecular Biotechnology before focusing towards Computational and Systems Biology during his MSc. After graduating from Heidelberg University in 2017, he became a Gates Cambridge Scholar and conducted a PhD at Cambridge University where his research addressed open questions in Aquatic Microbiology and Algae Biotechnology using high-throughput multi-omic approaches. In parallel, he co-founded and became co-leader of the citizen science project [PuntSeq](https://www.puntseq.co.uk), which aims for democratising novel real-time DNA sequencing technology and in 2021 presented an open-source, low-cost metagenomics framework to monitor microbial composition of freshwater sources. Andre obtained his PhD from the University of Cambridge in 2021. 

Since, he has been working as a Postdoctoral Research Associate for the Univeristy of Cambridge at the [Department of Plant Sciences](https://www.plantsci.cam.ac.uk/directory/andre-holzer). 

In 2023 he joined the [Center for Bioinformatics](https://zbi-www.bioinf.uni-sb.de) (ZBI) at Saarland University (Germany) where he is working as a semi-independent researcher on Microbial Systems Biology and Long-Read Sequencing. Coupling his expertise in Microbiology, Computational Biology and portable DNA Sequencing, Dr Holzer leverages long-read sequening technologies and develops new frameworks to better understand, detect and use microbes in the context of One Health.
