I am a biologist (genetics, genomics, evolutionary biology) turned bioinformatician, trying my best to contribute to open, inclusive and reproducible science.
Currently, I mostly work on sequencing data for projects in immuno-oncology and hematopoiesis, developing models, tools and workflows.
One major focus is on the calling of variation.
