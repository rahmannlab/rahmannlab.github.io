I am a staff scientist at the Institute of pathology at University Hospital Essen and a PhD student in Sven Rahmann's Genome Informatics group.
My focus is on analyzing exome sequencing data for structural variants.
Currently I am developing a tool for estimating CNVs on exome data based on the R-package CopywriteR.
Furthermore, I'm involved in the development and maintenance of [EAGLE](/research/eagle/), an exome analysis tool.
