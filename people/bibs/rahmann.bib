	contexts and report new more specific ones.Checking for error-inducing

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The application of DNA microarray technology
	in post-genomic analysis of bacterial genome sequences has allowed
	the generation of huge amounts of data related to regulatory networks.
	This data along with literature-derived knowledge on regulation of
	gene expression has opened the way for genome-wide reconstruction
	of transcriptional regulatory networks. These large-scale reconstructions
	can be converted into in silico models of bacterial cells that allow
	a systematic analysis of network behavior in response to changing
	environmental conditions. Description CoryneRegNet was designed to
	facilitate the genome-wide reconstruction of transcriptional regulatory
	networks of corynebacteria relevant in biotechnology and human medicine.
	During the import and integration process of data derived from experimental
	studies or literature knowledge CoryneRegNet generates links to genome
	annotations, to identified transcription factors and to the corresponding
	cis-regulatory elements. CoryneRegNet is based on a multi-layered,
	hierarchical and modular concept of transcriptional regulation and
	was implemented by using the relational database management system
	MySQL and an ontology-based data structure. Reconstructed regulatory
	networks can be visualized by using the yFiles JAVA graph library.
	As an application example of CoryneRegNet, we have reconstructed
	the global transcriptional regulation of a cellular module involved
	in SOS and stress response of corynebacteria. CONCLUSIONS: CoryneRegNet
	is an ontology-based data warehouse that allows pertinent data management
	of regulatory interactions along with the genome-scale reconstruction
	of transcriptional regulatory networks. These models can further
	be combined with metabolic networks to build integrated models of
	cellular function including both metabolism and its transcriptional
	regulation.},

  journal = {BMC Syst Biol},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {3},
  pages = {8},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transcriptional regulation of gene activity is essential
	for any living organism. Transcription factors therefore recognize
	specific binding sites within the DNA to regulate the expression
	of particular target genes. The genome-scale reconstruction of the
	emerging regulatory networks is important for biotechnology and human
	medicine but cost-intensive, time-consuming, and impossible to perform
	for any species separately. By using bioinformatics methods one can
	partially transfer networks from well-studied model organisms to
	closely related species. However, the prediction quality is limited
	by the low level of evolutionary conservation of the transcription
	factor binding sites, even within organisms of the same genus. RESULTS:
	Here we present an integrated bioinformatics workflow that assures
	the reliability of transferred gene regulatory networks. Our approach
	combines three methods that can be applied on a large-scale: re-assessment
	of annotated binding sites, subsequent binding site prediction, and
	homology detection. A gene regulatory interaction is considered to
	be conserved if (1) the transcription factor, (2) the adjusted binding
	site, and (3) the target gene are conserved. The power of the approach
	is demonstrated by transferring gene regulations from the model organism
	Corynebacterium glutamicum to the human pathogens C. diphtheriae,
	C. jeikeium, and the biotechnologically relevant C. efficiens. For
	these three organisms we identified reliable transcriptional regulations
	for ~40\% of the common transcription factors, compared to ~5\% for
	which knowledge was available before. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest
	that trustworthy genome-scale transfer of gene regulatory networks
	between organisms is feasible in general but still limited by the
	level of evolutionary conservation.},

	minimization problem and asks to distribute oligonucleotide probes
	on a microarray and to determine their embeddings in the deposition
	sequence in such a way that the overall quality of the resulting
	synthesized probes is maximized. Because of its inherent computational
	complexity, it is traditionally attacked in several phases: partitioning,
	placement, and re-embedding. We present the first algorithm, Greedy+,
	that combines placement and embedding and results in improved layouts
	in terms of border length and conflict index (a more realistic measure
	of probe quality), both on arrays of random probes and on existing
	Affymetrix GeneChip((R)) arrays. We also present a large-scale study
	on how the layouts of GeneChip arrays have improved over time, and
	show how Greedy+ can further improve layout quality by as much as
	8\% in terms of border length and 34\% in terms of conflict index.},

  abstract = {Nager syndrome (MIM #154400) is the best-known preaxial acrofacial
	dysostosis, mainly characterized by craniofacial and preaxial limb
	anomalies. The craniofacial abnormalities mainly consist of downslanting
	palpebral fissures, malar hypoplasia, micrognathia, external ear
	anomalies, and cleft palate. The preaxial limb defects are characterized
	by radial and thumb hypoplasia or aplasia, duplication of thumbs
	and proximal radioulnar synostosis. Haploinsufficiency of SF3B4 (MIM
	*605593), which encodes SAP49, a component of the pre-mRNA spliceosomal
	complex, has recently been identified as the underlying cause of
	Nager syndrome. In our study, we performed exome sequencing in two
	and Sanger sequencing of SF3B4 in further ten previously unreported
	patients with the clinical diagnosis of Nager syndrome, including
	one familial case. We identified heterozygous SF3B4 mutations in
	seven out of twelve patients. Four of the seven mutations were shown
	to be de novo; in three individuals, DNA of both parents was not
	available. No familial mutations were discovered. Three mutations
	were nonsense, three were frameshift mutations and one T > C transition
	destroyed the translation start signal. In three of four SF3B4 negative
	families, EFTUD2 was analyzed, but no pathogenic variants were identified.
	Our results indicate that the SF3B4 gene is mutated in about half
	of the patients with the clinical diagnosis of Nager syndrome and
	further support genetic heterogeneity for this condition.},

  abstract = {The Enterobacteriaceae comprise a large number of clinically relevant
	species with several individual subspecies. Overlapping virulence-associated
	gene pools and the high overall genome plasticity often interferes
	with correct enterobacterial strain typing and risk assessment. Array
	technology offers a fast, reproducible and standardisable means for
	bacterial typing and thus provides many advantages for bacterial
	diagnostics, risk assessment and surveillance. The development of
	highly discriminative broad-range microbial diagnostic microarrays
	remains a challenge, because of marked genome plasticity of many
	bacterial pathogens.We developed a DNA microarray for strain typing
	and detection of major antimicrobial resistance genes of clinically
	relevant enterobacteria. For this purpose, we applied a global genome-wide
	probe selection strategy on 32 available complete enterobacterial
	genomes combined with a regression model for pathogen classification.
	The discriminative power of the probe set was further tested in silico
	on 15 additional complete enterobacterial genome sequences. DNA microarrays
	based on the selected probes were used to type 92 clinical enterobacterial
	isolates. Phenotypic tests confirmed the array-based typing results
	and corroborate that the selected probes allowed correct typing and
	prediction of major antibiotic resistances of clinically relevant
	Enterobacteriaceae, including the subspecies level, e.g. the reliable
	distinction of different E. coli pathotypes.Our results demonstrate
	that the global probe selection approach based on longest common
	factor statistics as well as the design of a DNA microarray with
	a restricted set of discriminative probes enables robust discrimination
	of different enterobacterial variants and represents a proof of concept
	that can be adopted for diagnostics of a wide range of microbial
	pathogens. Our approach circumvents misclassifications arising from
	the application of virulence markers, which are highly affected by
	horizontal gene transfer. Moreover, a broad range of pathogens have
	been covered by an efficient probe set size enabling the design of
	high-throughput diagnostics.},

	of this approach to the integrin adhesome network extracted from

	describe interaction dependencies. We visualize the obtained hypernetwork

  abstract = {We present a comprehensive review on probabilistic arithmetic automata
	(PAAs), a general model to describe chains of operations whose operands
	depend on chance, along with two algorithms to numerically compute
	the distribution of the results of such probabilistic calculations.
	PAAs provide a unifying framework to approach many problems arising
	in computational biology and elsewhere. We present five different
	applications, namely (1) pattern matching statistics on random texts,
	including the computation of the distribution of occurrence counts,
	waiting times, and clump sizes under hidden Markov background models;
	(2) exact analysis of window-based pattern matching algorithms; (3)
	sensitivity of filtration seeds used to detect candidate sequence
	alignments; (4) length and mass statistics of peptide fragments resulting
	from enzymatic cleavage reactions; and (5) read length statistics
	of 454 and IonTorrent sequencing reads. The diversity of these applications
	indicates the flexibility and unifying character of the presented
	framework. While the construction of a PAA depends on the particular
	application, we single out a frequently applicable construction method:
	We introduce deterministic arithmetic automata (DAAs) to model deterministic
	calculations on sequences, and demonstrate how to construct a PAA
	from a given DAA and a finite-memory random text model. This procedure
	is used for all five discussed applications and greatly simplifies
	the construction of PAAs.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The motif discovery problem consists of finding over-represented
	patterns in a collection of biosequences. It is one of the classical
	sequence analysis problems, but still has not been satisfactorily
	solved in an exact and efficient manner. This is partly due to the
	large number of possibilities of defining the motif search space
	and the notion of over-representation. Even for well-defined formalizations,
	the problem is frequently solved in an ad hoc manner with heuristics
	that do not guarantee to find the best motif. RESULTS: We show how
	to solve the motif discovery problem (almost) exactly on a practically
	relevant space of IUPAC generalized string patterns, using the p-value
	with respect to an i.i.d. model or a Markov model as the measure
	of over-representation. In particular, (i) we use a highly accurate
	compound Poisson approximation for the null distribution of the number
	of motif occurrences. We show how to compute the exact clump size
	distribution using a recently introduced device called probabilistic
	arithmetic automaton (PAA). (ii) We define two p-value scores for
	over-representation, the first one based on the total number of motif
	occurrences, the second one based on the number of sequences in a
	collection with at least one occurrence. (iii) We describe an algorithm
	to discover the optimal pattern with respect to either of the scores.
	The method exploits monotonicity properties of the compound Poisson
	approximation and is by orders of magnitude faster than exhaustive
	enumeration of IUPAC strings (11.8 h compared with an extrapolated
	runtime of 4.8 years). (iv) We justify the use of the proposed scores
	for motif discovery by showing our method to outperform other motif
	discovery algorithms (e.g. MEME, Weeder) on benchmark datasets. We
	also propose new motifs on Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Availability
	and Implementation: The method has been implemented in Java. It can
	be obtained from http://ls11-www.cs.tu-dortmund.de/people/marschal/paa_md/.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The introduction of high-throughput genome sequencing
	and post-genome analysis technologies, e.g. DNA microarray approaches,
	has created the potential to unravel and scrutinize complex gene-regulatory
	networks on a large scale. The discovery of transcriptional regulatory
	interactions has become a major topic in modern functional genomics.
	RESULTS: To facilitate the analysis of gene-regulatory networks,
	we have developed CoryneCenter, a web-based resource for the systematic
	integration and analysis of genome, transcriptome, and gene regulatory
	information for prokaryotes, especially corynebacteria. For this
	purpose, we extended and combined the following systems into a common
	platform: (1) GenDB, an open source genome annotation system, (2)
	EMMA, a MAGE compliant application for high-throughput transcriptome
	data storage and analysis, and (3) CoryneRegNet, an ontology-based
	data warehouse designed to facilitate the reconstruction and analysis
	of gene regulatory interactions. We demonstrate the potential of
	CoryneCenter by means of an application example. Using microarray
	hybridization data, we compare the gene expression of Corynebacterium
	glutamicum under acetate and glucose feeding conditions: Known regulatory
	networks are confirmed, but moreover CoryneCenter points out additional
	regulatory interactions. CONCLUSION: CoryneCenter provides more than
	the sum of its parts. Its novel analysis and visualization features
	significantly simplify the process of obtaining new biological insights
	into complex regulatory systems. Although the platform currently
	focusses on corynebacteria, the integrated tools are by no means
	restricted to these species, and the presented approach offers a
	general strategy for the analysis and verification of gene regulatory
	networks. CoryneCenter provides freely accessible projects with the
	underlying genome annotation, gene expression, and gene regulation
	data. The system is publicly available at http://www.CoryneCenter.de.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Transcription factors (TFs) play a key role in gene regulation
	by binding to target sequences. In silico prediction of potential
	binding of a TF to a binding site is a well-studied problem in computational
	biology. The binding sites for one TF are represented by a position
	frequency matrix (PFM). The discovery of new PFMs requires the comparison
	to known PFMs to avoid redundancies. In general, two PFMs are similar
	if they occur at overlapping positions under a null model. Still,
	most existing methods compute similarity according to probabilistic
	distances of the PFMs. Here we propose a natural similarity measure
	based on the asymptotic covariance between the number of PFM hits
	incorporating both strands. Furthermore, we introduce a second measure
	based on the same idea to cluster a set of the Jaspar PFMs. RESULTS:
	We show that the asymptotic covariance can be efficiently computed
	by a two dimensional convolution of the score distributions. The
	asymptotic covariance approach shows strong correlation with simulated
	data. It outperforms three alternative methods. The Jaspar clustering
	yields distinct groups of TFs of the same class. Furthermore, a representative
	PFM is given for each class. In contrast to most other clustering
	methods, PFMs with low similarity automatically remain singletons.

	is a ubiquitous problem in computational biology with diverse applications,

	many of them produce clusterings that can be further improved. "Cleaning
	up" initial clusterings can be formalized as projecting a graph on
	the space of transitive graphs; it is also known as the cluster editing
	or cluster partitioning problem in the literature. In contrast to
	previous work on cluster editing, we allow arbitrary weights on the
	similarity graph. To solve the so-defined weighted transitive graph
	projection problem, we present (1) the first exact fixed-parameter
	algorithm, (2) a polynomial-time greedy algorithm that returns the
	optimal result on a well-defined subset of "close-to-transitive"
	graphs and works heuristically on other graphs, and (3) a fast heuristic
	that uses ideas similar to those from the Fruchterman-Reingold graph
	layout algorithm. We compare quality and running times of these algorithms
	on both artificial graphs and protein similarity graphs derived from
	the 66 organisms of the COG dataset.},

	of the RNA-producing machinery. Neuroblastoma is a tumor of early
	childhood characterized by heterogeneous clinical courses. Amplification
	of the MYCN oncogene is a marker of poor patient outcome in this
	disease. Here, we investigated the MYCN-driven transcriptome of 20
	primary neuroblastomas with and without MYCN amplification using
	next-generation RNA sequencing and compared the results to those
	from an in vitro cell model for inducible MYCN (SH-EP MYCN-ER). Transcriptome
	sequencing produced 30-90 million mappable reads for each dataset.
	The most abundant RNA species was mRNA, but snoRNAs, pseudogenes
	and processed transcripts were also recovered. A total of 223 genes
	were significantly differentially expressed between MYCN-amplified
	and single-copy tumors. Of those genes associated with MYCN both
	in vitro and in vivo, 32\% of MYCN upregulated and 37\% of MYCN downregulated
	genes were verified either as previously identified MYCN targets
	or as having MYCN-binding motifs. Pathway analyses suggested transcriptomal
	upregulation of mTOR-related genes by MYCN. MYCN-driven neuroblastomas
	in mice displayed activation of the mTOR pathway on the protein level
	and activation of MYCN in SH-EP MYCN-ER cells resulted in high sensitivity
	toward mTOR inhibition in vitro. We conclude that next-generation
	RNA sequencing allows for the identification of MYCN regulated transcripts
	in neuroblastoma. As our results suggest MYCN involvement in mTOR
	pathway activation on the transcriptional level, mTOR inhibitors
	should be further evaluated for the treatment of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma.},

	accuracy of gene-based expression profiles using neuroblastoma as
	a model.Methods:In a patient cohort comprising 113 primary neuroblastoma
	specimens expression profiling using exon-level analyses was performed
	to define predictive signatures using various machine-learning techniques.
	Alternative transcript use was calculated from relative exon expression.
	Validation of alternative transcripts was achieved using qPCR- and
	cell-based approaches.Results:Both predictors derived from the gene
	or the exon levels resulted in prediction accuracies >80\% for both
	event-free and overall survival and proved as independent prognostic
	markers in multivariate analyses. Alternative transcript use was
	most prominently linked to the amplification status of the MYCN oncogene,
	expression of the TrkA/NTRK1 neurotrophin receptor and survival.Conclusion:As
	exon level-based prediction yields comparable, but not significantly
	better, prediction accuracy than gene expression-based predictors,
	gene-based assays seem to be sufficiently precise for predicting
	outcome of neuroblastoma patients. However, exon-level analyses provide

	proposed to detect, extract and visualize their most significant
	properties. To the same extent that site-specific methods like sequence
	logos successfully visualize site conservations and sequence-based
	methods like clustering approaches detect relationships between sequences,
	both types of methods fail at revealing informational elements of
	MSAs at the level of sequence-site interactions, i.e. finding clusters
	of sequences and sites responsible for their clustering, which together
	account for a high fraction of the overall information of the MSA.
	To fill this gap, we present here a method that combines the Fisher
	score-based embedding of sequences from a profile hidden Markov model
	(pHMM) with correspondence analysis. This method is capable of detecting
	and visualizing group-specific or conflicting signals in an MSA and
	allows for a detailed explorative investigation of alignments of
	any size tractable by pHMMs. Applications of our methods are exemplified
	on an alignment of the Neisseria surface antigen LP2086, where it
	is used to detect sites of recombinatory horizontal gene transfer
	and on the vitamin K epoxide reductase family to distinguish between
	evolutionary and functional signals.},

	deletions and mutations in EFTUD2 were determined to cause syndromic
	esophageal atresia (EA), as well. We set forth to find further conditions
	caused by mutations in the EFTUD2 gene (OMIM *603892).We performed
	exome sequencing in two familial cases with clinical features overlapping
	with MFDGA and EA, but which were previously assumed to represent
	distinct entities, a syndrome with esophageal atresia, hypoplasia
	of zygomatic complex, microcephaly, cup-shaped ears, congenital heart
	defect, and intellectual disability in a mother and her two children
	[AJMG 143A(11):1135-1142, 2007] and a supposedly autosomal recessive
	oto-facial syndrome with midline malformations in two sisters [AJMG
	132(4):398-401, 2005]. While the analysis of our exome data was in
	progress, a recent publication made EFTUD2 mutations highly likely
	in these families. This hypothesis could be confirmed with exome
	as well as with Sanger sequencing. Also, in three further sporadic
	patients, clinically overlapping to these two families, de novo mutations
	within EFTUD2 were identified by Sanger sequencing. Our clinical
	and molecular workup of the patients discloses a broad phenotypic
	spectrum, and describes for the first time an instance of germline
	mosaicism for an EFTUD2 mutation.The clinical features of the eight
	patients described here further broaden the phenotypic spectrum caused
	by EFTUD2 mutations or deletions. We here show, that it not only
	includes mandibulofacial dysostosis type Guion-Almeida, which should
	be reclassified as an acrofacial dysostosis because of thumb anomalies
	(present in 12/35 or 34\% of patients) and syndromic esophageal atresia
	[JMG 49(12). 737-746, 2012], but also the two new syndromes, namely
	oto-facial syndrome with midline malformations published by Mégarbané
	et al. [AJMG 132(4): 398-401, 2005] and the syndrome published by
	Wieczorek et al. [AJMG 143A(11): 1135-1142, 2007] The finding of
	mild phenotypic features in the mother of one family that could have
	been overlooked and the possibility of germline mosaicism in apparently
	healthy parents in the other family should be taken into account
	when counseling such families.},

	dysfunction of a second chromatin remodeling complex in the pathogenesis

	with the initial diagnosis of NCBRS. These individuals apparently

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Detecting groups of functionally related proteins
	from their amino acid sequence alone has been a long-standing challenge
	in computational genome research. Several clustering approaches,
	following different strategies, have been published to attack this
	problem. Today, new sequencing technologies provide huge amounts
	of sequence data that has to be efficiently clustered with constant
	or increased accuracy, at increased speed. RESULTS: We advocate that
	the model of weighted cluster editing, also known as transitive graph
	projection is well-suited to protein clustering. We present the FORCE
	heuristic that is based on transitive graph projection and clusters
	arbitrary sets of objects, given pairwise similarity measures. In
	particular, we apply FORCE to the problem of protein clustering and
	show that it outperforms the most popular existing clustering tools
	(Spectral clustering, TribeMCL, GeneRAGE, Hierarchical clustering,
	and Affinity Propagation). Furthermore, we show that FORCE is able
	to handle huge datasets by calculating clusters for all 192,187 prokaryotic
	protein sequences (66 organisms) obtained from the COG database.
	Finally, FORCE is integrated into the corynebacterial reference database
	CoryneRegNet. CONCLUSIONS: FORCE is an applicable alternative to
	existing clustering algorithms. Its theoretical foundation, weighted
	cluster editing, can outperform other clustering paradigms on protein
	homology clustering. FORCE is open source and implemented in Java.
	The software, including the source code, the clustering results for
	COG and CoryneRegNet, and all evaluation datasets are available at

  abstract = {Molecular database search tools need statistical models to assess
	the significance for the resulting hits. In the classical approach
	one asks the question how probable a certain score is observed by
	pure chance. Asymptotic theories for such questions are available
	for two random i.i.d. sequences. Some effort had been made to include
	effects of finite sequence lengths and to account for specific compositions
	of the sequences. In many applications, such as a large-scale database
	homology search for transmembrane proteins, these models are not
	the most appropriate ones. Search sensitivity and specificity benefit
	from position-dependent scoring schemes or use of Hidden Markov Models.
	Additional, one may wish to go beyond the assumption that the sequences
	are i.i.d. Despite their practical importance, the statistical properties
	of these settings have not been well investigated yet.In this paper,
	we discuss an efficient and general method to compute the score distribution
	to any desired accuracy. The general approach may be applied to different
	sequence models and and various similarity measures that satisfy
	a few weak assumptions. We have access to the low-probability region
	("tail") of the distribution where scores are larger than expected
	by pure chance and therefore relevant for practical applications.
	Our method uses recent ideas from rare-event simulations, combining
	Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations with importance sampling and
	generalized ensembles. We present results for the score statistics
	of fixed and random queries against random sequences. In a second
	step, we extend the approach to a model of transmembrane proteins,
	which can hardly be described as i.i.d. sequences. For this case,
	we compare the statistical properties of a fixed query model as well
	as a hidden Markov sequence model in connection with a position based
	scoring scheme against the classical approach.The results illustrate
	that the sensitivity and specificity strongly depend on the underlying
	scoring and sequence model. A specific ROC analysis for the case
	of transmembrane proteins supports our observation.},
