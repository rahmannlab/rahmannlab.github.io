  Abstract                 = {We studied the impact of protist grazing and exudation on the growth and transcriptomic response of the prokaryotic prey species \textit{Polynucleobacter asymbioticus}.
Different single- and multi-species communities of chrysophytes were used to determine a species-specific response to the predators and the effect of chrysophyte diversity.
We sequenced the mRNA of \textit{Pn. asymbioticus} in communities with three single chrysophyte species (\textit{Chlorochromonas danica}, \textit{Poterioochromonas malhamensis} and \textit{Poteriospumella lacustris}) and all combinations.
The molecular responses of \textit{Pn. asymbioticus} significantly changed in the presence of predators with different trophic modes and combinations of species.
In the single-species samples we observed significant differences related to the relative importance of grazing and exudation in the protist-bacteria interaction, i.e. to the presence of either the heterotrophic \textit{Ps. lacustris} or the mixotrophic \textit{C. danica}.
When grazing dominates the interaction, as in the presence of \textit{Ps. lacustris}, genes acting in stress response are up-regulated. 
Further genes associated with transcription and translation are down-regulated indicating a reduced growth of \textit{Pn. asymbioticus}. 
In contrast, when the potential use of algal exudates dominates the interaction, genes affiliated with iron transport are up-regulated. 
Rapid phototrophic growth of chrysophytes, with a high demand on soluble iron, could thus lead to iron-limitation and cause changes in the iron metabolism of \textit{Pn. asymbioticus}.
Additionally, we observe a benefit for \textit{Pn. asymbioticus} from a more diverse protistan community, which could be due to shifts in the relative importance of phototrophy in the mixotrophic chrysophytes when competing for food with other species.
Our study highlights the importance of biotic interactions and the specificity of such interactions, in particular the differential effect of grazing and algal exudation in the interaction of bacteria with mixotrophic protists.},

  Abstract                 = {High-throughput molecular data provide a wealth of information that can be integrated into network analysis. Several approaches exist that identify functional modules in the context of integrated biological networks. The objective of this study is 2-fold: first, to assess the accuracy and variability of identified modules and second, to develop an algorithm for deriving highly robust and accurate solutions. In a comparative simulation study accuracy and robustness of the proposed and established methodologies are validated, considering various sources of variation in the data. To assess this variation, we propose a jackknife resampling procedure resulting in an ensemble of optimal modules. A consensus approach summarizes the ensemble into one final module containing maximally robust nodes and edges. The resulting consensus module identifies and visualizes robust and variable regions by assigning support values to nodes and edges. Finally, the proposed approach is exemplified on two large gene expression studies: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Chrysophytes are protist model species in ecology and ecophysiology and important grazers of bacteria-sized microorganisms and primary producers. However, they have not yet been investigated in detail at the molecular level, and no genomic and only little transcriptomic information is available. Chrysophytes exhibit different trophic modes: while phototrophic chrysophytes perform only photosynthesis, mixotrophs can gain carbon from bacterial food as well as from photosynthesis, and heterotrophs solely feed on bacteria-sized microorganisms. Recent phylogenies and megasystematics demonstrate an immense complexity of eukaryotic diversity with numerous transitions between phototrophic and heterotrophic organisms. The question we aim to answer is how the diverse nutritional strategies, accompanied or brought about by a reduction of the plasmid and size reduction in heterotrophic strains, affect physiology and molecular processes. Results: We sequenced the mRNA of 18 chrysophyte strains on the Illumina HiSeq platform and analysed the transcriptomes to determine relations between the trophic mode (mixotrophic vs. heterotrophic) and gene expression. We observed an enrichment of genes for photosynthesis, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism for phototrophic and mixotrophic strains that can perform photosynthesis. Genes involved in nutrient absorption, environmental information processing and various transporters (e.g.,Â monosaccharide, peptide, lipid transporters) were present or highly expressed only in heterotrophic strains that have to sense, digest and absorb bacterial food. We furthermore present a transcriptome-based alignment-free phylogeny construction approach using transcripts assembled from short reads to determine the evolutionary relationships between the strains and the possible influence of nutritional strategies on the reconstructed phylogeny. We discuss the resulting phylogenies in comparison to those from established approaches based on ribosomal RNA and orthologous genes. Finally, we make functionally annotated reference transcriptomes of each strain available to the community, significantly enhancing publicly available data on Chrysophyceae.
Conclusions: Our study is the first comprehensive transcriptomic characterisation of a diverse set of Chrysophyceaen strains. In addition, we showcase the possibility of inferring phylogenies from assembled transcriptomes using an alignment-free approach. The raw and functionally annotated data we provide will prove beneficial for further examination of the diversity within this taxon. Our molecular characterisation of different trophic modes presents a first such example. },

  Abstract                 = {Background: High-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies are increasingly applied to analyse complex microbial ecosystems by mRNA sequencing of whole communities, also known as metatranscriptome sequencing. This approach is at the moment largely limited to prokaryotic communities and communities of few eukaryotic species with sequenced genomes. For eukaryotes the analysis is hindered mainly by a low and fragmented coverage of the reference databases to infer the community composition, but also by lack of automated workflows for the task.
Results: From the databases of the National Center for Biotechnology Information and Marine Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project, 142 references were selected in such a way that the taxa represent the main lineages within each of the seven supergroups of eukaryotes and possess predominantly complete transcriptomes or genomes. From these references, we created an annotated microeukaryotic reference database. We developed a tool called TaxMapper for a reliably mapping of sequencing reads against this database and filtering of unreliable assignments. For filtering, a classifier was trained and tested on each of the following: sequences of taxa in the database, sequences of taxa related to those in the database, and random sequences. Additionally, TaxMapper is part of a metatranscriptomic Snakemake workflow developed to perform quality assessment, functional and taxonomic annotation and (multivariate) statistical analysis including environmental data. The workflow is provided and described in detail to empower researchers to apply it for metatranscriptome analysis of any environmental sample.
Conclusions: TaxMapper shows superior performance compared to standard approaches, resulting in a higher number of true positive taxonomic assignments. Both the TaxMapper tool and the workflow are available as open-source code at Bitbucket under the MIT license: https://bitbucket.org/dbeisser/taxmapperand as a Bioconda package: https://bioconda.github.io/recipes/taxmapper/README.html.},

  Abstract                 = {Tardigrades are multicellular organisms, resistant to extreme environmental changes such as heat, drought, radiation and freezing. They outlast these conditions in an inactive form (tun) to escape damage to cellular structures and cell death. Tardigrades are apparently able to prevent or repair such damage and are therefore a crucial model organism for stress tolerance. Cultures of the tardigrade Milnesium tardigradum were dehydrated by removing the surrounding water to induce tun formation. During this process and the subsequent rehydration, metabolites were measured in a time series by GC-MS. Additionally expressed sequence tags are available, especially libraries generated from the active and inactive state. The aim of this integrated analysis is to trace changes in tardigrade metabolism and identify pathways responsible for their extreme resistance against physical stress. In this study we propose a novel integrative approach for the analysis of metabolic networks to identify modules of joint shifts on the transcriptomic and metabolic levels. We derive a tardigrade-specific metabolic network represented as an undirected graph with 3,658 nodes (metabolites) and 4,378 edges (reactions). Time course metabolite profiles are used to score the network nodes showing a significant change over time. The edges are scored according to information on enzymes from the EST data. Using this combined information, we identify a key subnetwork (functional module) of concerted changes in metabolic pathways, specific for de- and rehydration. The module is enriched in reactions showing significant changes in metabolite levels and enzyme abundance during the transition. It resembles the cessation of a measurable metabolism (e.g. glycolysis and amino acid anabolism) during the tun formation, the production of storage metabolites and bioprotectants, such as DNA stabilizers, and the generation of amino acids and cellular components from monosaccharides as carbon and energy source during rehydration. The functional module identifies relationships among changed metabolites (e.g. spermidine) and reactions and provides first insights into important altered metabolic pathways. With sparse and diverse data available, the presented integrated metabolite network approach is suitable to integrate all existing data and analyse it in a combined manner.},

  Abstract                 = {Aquatic environments are heavily impacted by human activities including climate warming and the introduction of xenobiotics. Due to the application of silver nanoparticles as bactericidal agent the introduction of silver into the environment strongly has increased during the past years. Silver ions affect the primary metabolism of algae, in particular photosynthesis. Mixotrophic algae are an interesting test case as they do not exclusively rely on photosynthesis which may attenuate the harmful effect of silver. In order to study the effect of silver ions on mixotrophs, cultures of the chrysophyte Poterioochromonas malhamensis were treated in a replicate design in light and darkness with silver nitrate at a sub-lethal concentration. At five time points samples were taken for the identification and quantitation of proteins by mass spectrometry. In our analysis, relative quantitative protein mass spectrometry has shown to be a useful tool for functional analyses in conjunction with transcriptome reference sequences. A total of 3,952 proteins in 63 samples were identified and quantified, mapping to 4,829 transcripts of the sequenced and assembled transcriptome. Among them, 720 and 104 proteins performing various cellular functions were differentially expressed after eight days in light versus darkness and after three days of silver treatment, respectively. Specifically pathways of the energy and primary carbon metabolism were differentially affected by light and the utilization of expensive reactions hints to an energy surplus of P. malhamensis under light conditions. The excess energy is not invested in growth, but in the synthesis of storage metabolites. The effects of silver were less explicit, observable especially in the dark treatments where the light effect could not mask coinciding but weaker effects of silver. Photosynthesis, particularly the light harvesting complexes, and several sulphur containing enzymes were affected presumably due to a direct interference with the silver ions, mainly affecting energy supply.},

  Abstract                 = {Silver ions are among the predominant anthropogenic introduced pollutants in aquatic systems. As silver has effects on species at all trophic levels the community composition in aquatic habitats can be changed as a result of silver stress. The response of planktonic protists to environmental stressors is particularly important as they act both as producers and consumers in complex planktonic communities. Chrysomonad flagellates are of major interest, since this group includes heterotrophic, mixotrophic and phototrophic taxa, and therefore allows analysis of silver stress in organisms with contrasting nutritional strategies independent of a potential taxonomic bias. In a series of lab experiments, we compared the response of different trophic chrysophyte strains to low (5â¯Î¼gâ¯Lâ1), medium (10â¯Î¼gâ¯Lâ1) and high (20â¯Î¼gâ¯Lâ1) nominal Ag concentrations in combination with changes in temperature and light intensity (phototrophs), temperature and food concentration (heterotrophs), or a combination of the above settings (mixotrophs). All tested strains were negatively affected by silver in their growth rates. The phototrophic strains reacted strongly to silver stress, whereas light intensity and temperature had only minor effects on growth rates. For heterotrophic strains, high food concentration toned down the effect of silver, whereas temperatures outside the growth optimum had a combined stress effect. The mixotrophic strains reacted differently depending on whether their nutritional mode was dominated by heterotrophy or by phototrophy. The precise response pattern across all variables was uniquely different for every single species we tested. The present work contributes to a deeper understanding of the effects of environmental stressors on complex planktonic communities. It indicates that silver will negatively impact planktonic communities and may create shifts in their composition and functioning.},

  Abstract                 = {Among metal pollutants silver ions are one of the most toxic forms, and have thus been assigned to the highest toxicity class. Its toxicity to a wide range of microorganisms combined with its low toxicity to humans lead to the development of a wealth of silver-based products in many bactericidal applications accounting to more than 1000 nano-technology-based consumer products. Accordingly, silver is a widely distributed metal in the environment originating from its different forms of application as metal, salt and nanoparticle. A realistic assessment of silver nanoparticle toxicity in natural waters is, however, problematic and needs to be linked to experimental approaches. Here we apply metatranscriptome sequencing allowing for elucidating reactions of whole communities present in a water sample to stressors. We compared the toxicity of ionic silver and ligand-free silver nanoparticles by short term exposure on a natural community of aquatic microorganisms. We analyzed the effects of the treatments on metabolic pathways and species composition on the eukaryote metatranscriptome level in order to describe immediate molecular responses of organisms using a community approach. We found significant differences between the samples treated with 5 Âµg/L AgNO3 compared to the controls, but no significant differences in the samples treated with AgNP compared to the control samples. Statistical analysis yielded 126 genes (KO-IDs) with significant differential expression with a false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 between the control (KO) and AgNO3 (NO3) groups. A KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed significant results with a FDR below 0.05 for pathways related to photosynthesis. Our study therefore supports the view that ionic silver rather than silver nanoparticles are responsible for silver toxicity. Nevertheless, our results highlight the strength of metatranscriptome approaches for assessing metal toxicity on aquatic communities.},

  Abstract                 = {Protists influence ecosystems by modulating microbial population size, diversity, metabolic outputs and gene flow. In this study we used eukaryotic ribosomal amplicon diversity from 218 European freshwater lakes sampled in August 2012 to assess the effect of mountain ranges as biogeographic barriers on spatial patterns and microbial community structure in European freshwaters. The diversity of microbial communities as reflected by amplicon clusters suggested that the eukaryotic microbial inventory of lakes was well-sampled at the European and at the local scale. Our pan-European diversity analysis indicated that biodiversity and richness of high mountain lakes differed from that of lowland lakes. Further, the taxon inventory of high-mountain lakes strongly contributed to beta-diversity despite a low taxon inventory. Even though ecological factors, in general, strongly affect protist community pattern, we show that geographic distance and geographic barriers significantly contribute to community composition particularly for high mountain regions which presumably act as biogeographic islands. However, community composition in lowland lakes was also affected by geographic distance but less pronounced as in high mountain regions. In consequence protist populations are locally structured into distinct biogeographic provinces and community analyses revealed biogeographic patterns also for lowland lakes whereby European mountain ranges act as dispersal barriers in particular for short to intermediate distances whereas the effect of mountain ranges levels off on larger scale.},

  Abstract                 = {Integrative network analysis methods provide robust interpretations of differential high-throughput molecular profile measurements. They are often used in a biomedical context-to generate novel hypotheses about the underlying cellular processes or to derive biomarkers for classification and subtyping. The underlying molecular profiles are frequently measured and validated on animal or cellular models. Therefore the results are not immediately transferable to human. In particular, this is also the case in a study of the recently discovered interleukin-17 producing helper T cells (Th17), which are fundamental for anti-microbial immunity but also known to contribute to autoimmune diseases. We propose a mathematical model for finding active subnetwork modules that are conserved between two species. These are sets of genes, one for each species, which (i) induce a connected subnetwork in a species-specific interaction network, (ii) show overall differential behavior and (iii) contain a large number of orthologous genes. We propose a flexible notion of conservation, which turns out to be crucial for the quality of the resulting modules in terms of biological interpretability. We propose an algorithm that finds provably optimal or near-optimal conserved active modules in our model. We apply our algorithm to understand the mechanisms underlying Th17 T cell differentiation in both mouse and human. As a main biological result, we find that the key regulation of Th17 differentiation is conserved between human and mouse. xHeinz, an implementation of our algorithm, as well as all input data and results, are available at http://software.cwi.nl/xheinz and as a Galaxy service at http://services.cbib.u-bordeaux2.fr/galaxy in CBiB Tools.},

Growing data resources and new large-scale data (e.g. from large EST sequencing projects) allows to investigate tardigrade-specific adaptations. Bioinformatical analysis and methods follow the flow of genetic information from DNA to proteins, from sequences to protein clusters, from pathways and dynamics of adaptations. These methods include the usage of internal transcribed spacer 2 as a new phylogenetic marker. Next we present recent examples of bioinformatical analysis on tardigrades for these steps. This includes specific RNA stability motifs. Clustering of protein families reveals tardigrade-specific protein families and pathway analysis allows insights into mechanisms of oxidative stress tolerance, protein repair, protein turnover, DNA protection and stress-pathways. We focus in more detail on the diversity of DNA-j-like proteins that enhances the adaptation potential of Milnesium tardigradum. Finally, a sketch of adaptation dynamics in tardigrades is presented including techniques for dynamical modelling; yet, quantitative modelling requires far more data and detail.},

  Abstract                 = {Tardigrades have unique stress-adaptations that allow them to survive extremes of cold, heat, radiation and vacuum. To study this, encoded protein clusters and pathways from an ongoing transcriptome study on the tardigrade Milnesium tardigradum were analyzed using bioinformatics tools and compared to expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from Hypsibius dujardini, revealing major pathways involved in resistance against extreme environmental conditions. ESTs are available on the Tardigrade Workbench along with software and databank updates. Our analysis reveals that RNA stability motifs for M. tardigradum are different from typical motifs known from higher animals. M. tardigradum and H. dujardini protein clusters and conserved domains imply metabolic storage pathways for glycogen, glycolipids and specific secondary metabolism as well as stress response pathways (including heat shock proteins, bmh2, and specific repair pathways). Redox-, DNA-, stress- and protein protection pathways complement specific repair capabilities to achieve the strong robustness of M. tardigradum. These pathways are partly conserved in other animals and their manipulation could boost stress adaptation even in human cells. However, the unique combination of resistance and repair pathways make tardigrades and M. tardigradum in particular so highly stress resistant.},

A subset of these tumors originates from neural precursors, including the most aggressive forms of the childhood tumors, neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. In order to model the spectrum of MYCN-driven neoplasms in mice, we transgenically overexpressed MYCN under the control of the human GFAP-promoter that, among other targets, drives expression in neural progenitor cells. However, LSL-MYCN;hGFAP-Cre double transgenic mice did neither develop neural crest tumors nor tumors of the central nervous system, but presented with neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas and, less frequently, the pituitary gland. Pituitary tumors expressed chromogranin A and closely resembled human pituitary adenomas. Pancreatic tumors strongly produced and secreted glucagon, suggesting that they derived from glucagon- and GFAP-positive islet cells. Interestingly, 3 out of 9 human pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors expressed MYCN, supporting the similarity of the mouse tumors to the human system. Serial transplantations of mouse tumor cells into immunocompromised mice confirmed their fully transformed phenotype. MYCN-directed treatment by AuroraA- or Brd4-inhibitors resulted in significantly decreased cell proliferation in vitro and reduced tumor growth in vivo. In summary, we provide a novel mouse model for neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas and pituitary gland that is dependent on MYCN expression and that may help to evaluate MYCN-directed therapies.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Most protist lineages consist of members with diverging features e.g. different modes of nutrition and adaptations for life in different habitat types and climatic zones. The nutritional mode is particularly variable in chrysophytes and they are therefore an excellent model group to study the core genes and metabolic pathways of a functionally diverse lineage. The objective of our study is the identification of the joint genetic repertoire expressed in closely related chrysophytes as well as the extent of variation on species and strain level. Therefore, we investigated the transcriptomes of six strains belonging to four species of Ochromonadales. We performed analyses on metabolic pathway level as well as on sequence level.
Results: We could identify 1,574 core genes shared between all six investigated strains of Ochromonadales. Most of these core genes were affiliated with the primary metabolism. Phylogenetic analysis of 166 protein-coding core genes supported a close relation of Poteriospumella lacustris and Poterioochromonas malhamensis and resolved for more than 50\% of investigated genes the relationship of strains affiliated with the species P. lacustris. Further, we found diverging phylogenetic patterns for genes interacting with the environment.
Conclusions: In Ochromonadales, a functionally diverse lineage, the core transcriptome represents only a minor part of the individual transcriptomes. But this small fraction of genes comprises the basal metabolism essential for life in several protist lineages. Phylogenetic analyses of these genes indicate a similar degree of conservation as observed for genes coding for ribosomal proteins.},

The transition between nutritional modes is particularly pronounced in chrysophytes and occurred independently several times through parallel evolution. Thus, chrysophytes provide a unique opportunity for studying the molecular basis of nutritional diversification and of the accompanying pathway reduction and degradation of plastid structures. In order to analyze the succession in switching the nutritional mode from mixotrophy to heterotrophy, we compared the transcriptome of the mixotrophic Poterioochromonas malhamensis with the transcriptomes of three obligate heterotrophic species of Ochromonadales. We used the transcriptome of P. malhamensis as a reference for plastid reduction in the heterotrophic taxa. The analyzed heterotrophic taxa were in different stages of plastid reduction. We investigated the reduction of several photosynthesis related pathways e.g. the xanthophyll cycle, the mevalonate pathway, the shikimate pathway and the tryptophan biosynthesis as well as the reduction of plastid structures and postulate a presumable succession of pathway reduction and degradation of accompanying structures.},

Flooding can have both a stimulating and a harmful effect on the organisms of the respective habitats. The effects of short-term flooding on microeukaryotic communities in the aquatic and terrestrial habitat have so far been scarcely studied. Here, we investigated the effect of a 24 h artificial inundation on the microeukaryotic community composition in AquaFlow mesocosm systems. We investigated the shift of community composition based on molecular amplicon diversity both on soil and water during flooding and for a period of 12 d after flooding. Community composition was, as expected, strongly different between soil and water. Flooding had a significant effect on the freshwater community, whereas the soil community was hardly affected. In particular, we observed a transfer of nutrients from the terrestrial habitat into the aquatic habitat and identified ~50 taxa that were transferred by the flooding event. This effect of flooding was, however, overlaid by shifts of the communities with time, presumably reflecting an acclimatization to the conditions in the AquaFlow systems.},

Ecosystem functions are often stable despite considerable species turnover. Using metatranscriptome analyses, we analyse a thus-far unparalleled freshwater dataset which comprises 21 mainland European freshwater lakes from the Sierra Nevada (Spain) to the Carpathian Mountains (Romania) and from northern Germany to the Apennines (Italy) and covers an altitudinal range from 38 m above sea level (a.s.l) to 3110 m a.s.l. The dominant taxa were Chlorophyta and streptophytic algae, Ciliophora, Bacillariophyta and Chrysophyta. Metatranscriptomics provided insights into differences in community composition and into functional diversity via the relative share of taxa to the overall read abundance of distinct functional genes on the ecosystem level. The dominant metabolic pathways in terms of the fraction of expressed sequences in the cDNA libraries were affiliated with primary metabolism, specifically oxidative phosphorylation, photosynthesis and the TCA cycle. Our analyses indicate that community composition is a good first proxy for the analysis of ecosystem functions. However, differential gene regulation modifies the relative importance of taxa in distinct pathways. Whereas taxon composition varies considerably between lakes, the relative importance of distinct metabolic pathways is much more stable, indicating that ecosystem functioning is buffered against shifts in community composition through a functional redundancy of taxa.},

  Abstract                 = {Toll-like receptor (TLR) 13 and TLR2 are the major sensors of Gram-positive bacteria in mice. TLR13 recognizes Sa19, a specific 23S ribosomal (r) RNA-derived fragment and bacterial modification of Sa19 ablates binding to TLR13, and to antibiotics such as erythromycin. Similarly, RNase A-treated Staphylococcus aureus activate human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) only via TLR2, implying single-stranded (ss) RNA as major stimulant. Here, we identify human TLR8 as functional TLR13 equivalent that promiscuously senses ssRNA. Accordingly, Sa19 and mitochondrial (mt) 16S rRNA sequence-derived oligoribonucleotides (ORNs) stimulate PBMCs in a MyD88-dependent manner. These ORNs, as well as S. aureus-, Escherichia coli-, and mt-RNA, also activate differentiated human monocytoid THP-1 cells, provided they express TLR8. Moreover, Unc93b1(-/-)- and Tlr8(-/-)-THP-1 cells are refractory, while endogenous and ectopically expressed TLR8 confers responsiveness in a UR/URR RNA ligand consensus motif-dependent manner. If TLR8 function is inhibited by suppression of lysosomal function, antibiotic treatment efficiently blocks bacteria-driven inflammatory responses in infected human whole blood cultures. Sepsis therapy might thus benefit from interfering with TLR8 function.},

We here used whole-exome sequencing, mRNA expression profiling, array CGH and DNA methylation analysis to characterize 16 paired samples at diagnosis and relapse from individuals with neuroblastoma. The mutational burden significantly increased in relapsing tumors, accompanied by altered mutational signatures and reduced subclonal heterogeneity. Global allele frequencies at relapse indicated clonal mutation selection during disease progression. Promoter methylation patterns were consistent over disease course and were patient specific. Recurrent alterations at relapse included mutations in the putative CHD5 neuroblastoma tumor suppressor, chromosome 9p losses, DOCK8 mutations, inactivating mutations in PTPN14 and a relapse-specific activity pattern for the PTPN14 target YAP. Recurrent new mutations in HRAS, KRAS and genes mediating cell-cell interaction in 13 of 16 relapse tumors indicate disturbances in signaling pathways mediating mesenchymal transition. Our data shed light on genetic alteration frequency, identity and evolution in neuroblastoma.},

  Abstract                 = {Monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation involves major biochemical and structural changes. In order to elucidate the role of gene regulatory changes during this process, we used high-throughput sequencing to analyze the complete transcriptome and epigenome of human monocytes that were differentiated in vitro by addition of colony-stimulating factor 1 in serum-free medium. Numerous mRNAs and miRNAs were significantly up- or down-regulated. More than 100 discrete DNA regions, most often far away from transcription start sites, were rapidly demethylated by the ten eleven translocation enzymes, became nucleosome-free and gained histone marks indicative of active enhancers. These regions were unique for macrophages and associated with genes involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, phagocytosis and innate immune response. In summary, we have discovered a phagocytic gene network that is repressed by DNA methylation in monocytes and rapidly de-repressed after the onset of macrophage differentiation.},
