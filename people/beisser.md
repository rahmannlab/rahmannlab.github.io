I am a staff scientist in the department of Biodiversity headed by Jens Boenigk at the University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany.
I am working as a bioinformatician with a focus on next-generation sequencing analysis in biodiversity research.
This includes metagenome and -transcriptome studies for freshwater habitats, transcriptome and genome assemblies of protist model species (Chrysopyceae) and the assessment of their molecular reactions and responses to environmental stressors.
The previous five years a have worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the department of Genome Informatics headed by Sven Rahmann at the University Clinics in Essen.
Former projects included the detection of structural variants in damaged genomes, functional and taxonomic assessment in metatranscriptome sequencing data and the analysis of new pathogens by assembling the genome and transcriptome.
During my PhD I worked on methods for integrated network analysis using different Omics datasets in conjunction with biological networks.
