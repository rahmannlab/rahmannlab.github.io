Setup instructions for locally building our website with jekyll
===============================================================

You need ruby, and several ruby "gems": bundler, jekyll.
First, make sure that you do not have an old ruby version somewhere.
type -a ruby
type -a gem
type -a jekyll

should all turn up empty.
(If there is ruby/gem/jekyll in /usr/bin/, we will just overwrite it.)

Follow the instructions at https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/.
In brief:

sudo apt install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
gem install jekyll bundler

You can also install jekyll into your user directory, default `~/.gem`, by replacing the last line with
```bash
gem install --user-install jekyll bundler
```

Now verify (with type -a ...) that you have ruby, gem, jekyll in one(!) version only on your system.

You still don't have all themes for jekyll, but doing the following will auto-install them.

jekyll new TESTTEST
rm -rf TESTTEST



Setup of custom domains
=======================
(www.rahmannlab.de; genomeinformatics.uni-due.de)


The URL genomeinformatics.uni-due.de 
points to the public webspace of Sven's account
ht0884@staff.uni-duisburg-essen.de.
In the folder public_html/, we need a single file
.htaccesss
that will do a dirirect to www.rahmannlab.de or rahmannlab.github.io:
~~~
TODO: .htaccess contents
~~~

Alternative (if .htaccess does not work)
use a file index.php:
~~~
<?php
header("Location: https://rahmannlab.github.io/"); 
?>
~~~
This also redirects genomeinformatics.uni-due.de to rahmannlab.github.io.


Next, to use www.rahmannlab.de as a custom domain for the website,
Sven must set the CNAME entry of his domain at the provider (goneo) to
'rahmannlab.github.io'.
This is done via goneo's web interface.

In addition, under settings in gitlab,
"custom domain" must be set to www.rahmannlab.de
(scroll far down!).
(This simply creates a CNAME file with contents 'www.rahmannlab.de' in the repository.)
