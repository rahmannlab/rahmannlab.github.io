Setup instructions for locally building our website with jekyll
===============================================================

You need ruby, and several ruby "gems": bundler, jekyll.
First, make sure that you do not have an old ruby version somewhere.
type -a ruby
type -a gem
type -a jekyll

should all turn up empty.
(If there is ruby/gem/jekyll in /usr/bin/, we will just overwrite it.)

Follow the instructions at https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/.
In brief:

sudo apt install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
gem install jekyll bundler

You can also install jekyll into your user directory, default `~/.gem`, by replacing the last line with
```bash
gem install --user-install jekyll bundler
```

Now verify (with type -a ...) that you have ruby, gem, jekyll in one(!) verion only on your system.

You still don't have all themes for jekyll, but doing the following will auto-install them.

jekyll new TESTTEST
rm -rf TESTTEST
