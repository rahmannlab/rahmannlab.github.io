      <title>YeastScent: Volatile metabolites as quantitative proxy for metabolic network operation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae</title>

For rapid yeast production, the optimal feed rate is crucial: If too little glucose is provided, growth rate is not optimal. On the other hand, too much glucose leads to the so called crabtree effect where ethanol is produced, which leads to low-quality yeast or even to a lost batch.
In this project, we therefore aim to better understand the changes in metabolism during yeast fermentation just before the onset of ethanol production by monitoring volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measured by multi-capillary column ion mobility spectrometry (MCC/IMS).</description>

Osteoporosis is a disease in which reduced bone strength leads to a high risk of fractures. With more than 6 million affected patients in Germany, it is already seen as a national disease today. However, through demographic change, the number of affected people is constantly increasing.</description>

Next generation sequencing technologies are increasingly applied to analyse complex ecosystems by mRNA sequencing of whole communities. In principal, each sequenced mRNA allows an assignment of the underlying species as well as a functional annotation. While the functional information is sufficiently covered by databases such as Uniprot and NCBI the approach is currently limited by incomplete taxonomic references.

For an accurate assignment of taxonomic groups to environmental metatranscriptomic reads we build a custom database that comprises all major eukaryotic groups and a stand-alone tool to assign reads with a low false discovery rate.</description>

      <description>Exomate is an exome-sequencing pipeline with a web frontend. It automates most steps needed to go from FASTQ files to variant calls, puts the calls and metadata about patients, samples, etc. into a database and then allows interactive analysis via a web frontend. It is primarily designed for easy use and has already been used in various studies [1,2,3].

joint work with Cees Elzinga and Hui Wang
We have investigated several combinatorial problems (enumeration problems) related to subsequences within a sequence.
A subsequence is obtained from a string by deleting any number of characters; thus in contrast to a substring, a subsequence is not necessarily a contiguous part of the string. Counting subsequences under various constraints has become relevant to biological sequence analysis, to machine learning, to the analysis of categorical time series in the social sciences, and to the theory of word complexity.</description>

Probabilistic Arithmetic Automata are an extension of Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to allow (arithmetic or arbitrary binary) operations. Exact state-value probability distributions can be efficiently computed with in this framework, and many applications in string algorithmics and computational biology can be modeled in this framework and treated in a unifying manner.

Design of q-unique DNA sequences DNA nanoarchitechtures require carefully designed oligonucleotides with certain non-hybridization guarantees, which can be formalized as the q-uniqueness property on the sequence level. The challenge is to find a longest q-unique DNA sequence. This can be achieved by finding an Euler tour within the quotient graph of the De Bruijn graph (DBQG). For even q, self-complementary edges complicate the problem, and the graph has to be eulerized by deleting a minimum number of edges.</description>

      <title>Library complexity and duplication rate estimation</title>

      <description>Christopher Schröder, Sven Rahmann  In high-throughput sequencing (HTS) projects, the sequenced fragments’ duplicate rate is a key quality metric. A high duplicate rate may arise from a low amount of input DNA and many PCR cycles. Many methods for downstream analyses require that duplicates be removed. If the duplicate rate is high, most of the sequencing effort and money spent would have been in vain. Therefore, it is of considerable interest to estimate the duplicate rate after sequencing only a small subsample at low depth (multiplexed with other libraries) for quality control before running the full experiment.</description>

What is ddRAD-seq?  Double digest sequencing of restriction site associated DNA (ddRAD-seq) is used in population genomics in order to reduce the complexity of genomic data for inter- and intra-population analysis. The genetic diversity, meaning the abundance of different mutations in a population, can give insight into the quality of the habitat.
For example, if the diversity of two populations differs, this might be a sign for a stressor affecting one of the populations.</description>

   Protein interactions are fundamental building blocks of biochemical reaction systems underlying cellular functions. The complexity and functionality of such systems emerge not from the protein interactions themselves but from the dependencies between these interactions. Therefore, a comprehensive approach for integrating and using information about such dependencies is required.
We present an approach for endowing protein networks with interaction dependencies using propositional logic, thereby obtaining protein hypernetworks.</description>

      <title>DNA Motif Discovery</title>

      <description>Tobias Marschall &amp;amp; Sven Rahmann

The motif discovery problem consists of finding over-represented patterns in a collection of biosequences. It is one of the classical sequence analysis problems, but still has not been satisfactorily solved in an exact and efficient manner. This is partly due to the large number of possibilities of defining the motif search space and the notion of over-representation. Even for well-defined formalizations, the problem is frequently solved in an ad hoc manner with heuristics that do not guarantee to find the best motif.</description>

Oligonucleotide microarrays consist of small DNA fragments (probes) chemically synthesized at specific locations (spots) of a solid surface. Probes are typically 25 to 60 nucleotides long and are synthesized in parallel, in a series of repetitive steps. Each step appends a particular nucleotide to selected regions of the chip. Selection occurs by exposure to light with the help of a photolithographic mask or micromirror arrays.</description>

Ion mobility spectrometry measures ion intensity S(r,t) of a mixture of molecules after a certain retention time r in a separation phase and a certain drift time t (&amp;#8220;inverse ion mobility&amp;#8221;) in the spectrometer. Different molecules generally lead to distinct peaks in the intensity signal; so it is theoretically possible to identify and quantify a number of different metabolites, for example in exhaled human breath.</description>

      <description>We propose a framework for the exact probabilistic analysis of window-based pattern matching algorithms, such as Boyer-Moore, Horspool, Backward DAWG Matching, Backward Oracle Matching, and more.
In particular, we show how to efficiently obtain the distribution of such an algorithm&amp;#8217;s running time cost for any given pattern in a random text model, which can be quite general, from simple uniform models to higher-order Markov models or hidden Markov models (HMMs).</description>
