title: dupre
status: recent
author: Christopher Schr√∂der & Sven Rahmann
description: a tool to estimate the duplicate rate of a sequencing library at a given sequencing depth <i>N</i>, when the occupancy vector of a (small) subsample is known. This is useful when one has to decide which sequencing depth should be aimed for, weighing the potential of new discoveries vs. cost.
