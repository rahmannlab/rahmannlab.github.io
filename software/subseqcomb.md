description: Java classes for subsequence combinatorics. The Java class <tt>SubsequenceCombinatorics</tt> implements the algorithms described in our research project on subsequence combinatorics. The Java class <tt>SubsequenceCombinatoricsTest</tt> is a JUnit based test and at the same time demonstrates the use of the routines in <tt>SubsequenceCombinatorics.java</tt>. Documentation in html form is also included in the archive. In order to make the classes work on your system, you may have to change its <tt>package</tt> declaration.
