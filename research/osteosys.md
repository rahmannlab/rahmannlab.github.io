Osteoporosis is a disease in which reduced bone strength leads to a high risk of fractures.
With more than 6 million affected patients in Germany, it is already seen as a national disease today and through demographic change, the number of affected people is constantly increasing. This also increases the need for effective treatment.
Even though several therapy options exist, many problems remain unsolved.
Only part of the patients respond to existing drugs, while some have predispositions for side effects, e.g. aseptic necrosis of the bones.
Another problem are accompanying cardiovascular diseases.

In this project, we aim to establish a personalized therapy for osteoporosis.
We are responsible for evaluating the data raised from recruited patients.
This involves investigating the interplay of inflammation, bone metabolism, and the cardiovascular system on genetic and epigenetic level.
Based on the results, we aim to develop algorithms to identify complications in advance.

The project is supported by the European Regional Development Fund of the European Union.
