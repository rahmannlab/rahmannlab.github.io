title: Probabilistic Arithmetic Automata
members: Tobias Marschall & Sven Rahmann
#collaborators:
summary: Probabilistic Arithmetic Automata are an extension of Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to allow arithmetic or arbitrary binary operations. Exact state-value probability distributions can be efficiently computed with in this framework, and many applications in string algorithmics and computational biology can be modeled in this framework and treated in a unifying manner.

Probabilistic Arithmetic Automata are an extension of Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to allow arithmetic or arbitrary binary operations.
Exact state-value probability distributions can be efficiently computed with in this framework, and many applications in string algorithmics and computational biology can be modeled in this framework and treated in a unifying manner.
Our work included:

* Development of the PAA framework (CPM 2008)
* Application: [Exact analysis of pattern matching algorithms](/research/analysispattern/), e.g., Horspool, BNDM, BOM  (LATA 2010)
* Application: significance of motifs and DNA Motif discovery (CPM 2008)
* Application: seed sensitivity for seeded alignment (WABI 2008)
* Application: significance of peaks in mass spectra (RECOMB-Satellite conference on Proteomics and Systems Biology 2007; precedes the formal PAA definition)
