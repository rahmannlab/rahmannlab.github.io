Researchers from the Genome Informatics group attended the [Data Structures in Bioinformatics (DSB 2020)](https://dsb-meeting.github.io/DSB2020) in Rennes and presented their work.

Jens Zentgraf gave a talk about joint work with Henning Timm and Sven Rahmann, titled "Cost-optimal assignment of elements in genome-scale multi-way bucketed Cuckoo hash tables".

Sven Rahmann presented joint work with Jens Zentgraf on "Faster xenograft sorting with 3-way bucketed Cuckoo hash tables".

Even though it was raining in Rennes and Air France wasn't able to fly from DÃ¼sseldorf to Rennes in under 9 hours, the meeting was a lot of fun and showcased many interesting new results.
