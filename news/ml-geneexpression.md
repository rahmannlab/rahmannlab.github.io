Our article entitled [Machine learning reveals a PD-L1â€“independent prediction of response to immunotherapy of non-small cell lung cancer by gene expression context](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2020.09.015) is published in European Journal of Cancer and now available online.

We set out to apply context-sensitive feature selection and machine learning approaches on expression profiles of immune-related genes in diagnostic biopsies of patients with stage IV NSCLC.We applied supervised machine learning methods for feature selection and generation of predictive models.Feature selection and model creation were based on a training cohort of 55 patients with recurrent NSCLC treated with PD-1/PD-L1 antibody therapy. Resulting models identified patients with superior outcomes to immunotherapy, as validated in two subsequently recruited, separate patient cohorts (n = 67, hazard ratio = 0.46, p = 0.035). The predictive information obtained from these models was orthogonal to PD-L1 expression as per immunohistochemistry: Selecting by PD-L1 positivity at immunohistochemistry plus model prediction identified patients with highly favourable outcomes.Visualisation of the models revealed the predictive superiority of the entire 7-gene context over any single gene.

Using context-sensitive assays and bioinformatics capturing the tumour immune context allows precise prediction of response to PD-1/PD-L1-directed immunotherapy in NSCLC.
