Jens Zentgraf and Sven Rahmann gave a tutorial on [foundations of alignment-free sequence analysis: k-mer hashing](https://gcb2019.de/fundamentals-of-alignment-free-sequence-analysis-k-mer-hashing/) at the German Conference on Bioinformatics (GCB) 2019 in Heidelberg.

Over 20 participants attended the tutorial.
It was a lot of fun; we may do it again soon.
