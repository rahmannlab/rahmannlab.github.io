Our article ["wg-blimp: an end-to-end analysis pipeline for whole genome bisulfite sequencing data"](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-3470-5#Abs1)has been published in BMC Bioinformatics journal.
Overview:
We developed wg-blimp (whole genome bisulfite sequencing methylation analysis pipeline) as an end-to-end pipeline to ease whole genome bisulfite sequencing data analysis. It integrates established algorithms for alignment, quality control, methylation calling, detection of differentially methylated regions, and methylome segmentation, requiring only a reference genome and raw sequencing data as input. We improve on previous pipelines by providing a more comprehensive analysis workflow as well as an interactive user interface. 

We demonstrated its applicability by analysing multiple publicly available datasets. Thus, wg-blimp is a relevant alternative to previous analysis pipelines and may facilitate future epigenetic research.
