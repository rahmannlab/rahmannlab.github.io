As of today, Prof. Dr. Sven Rahmann now heads the new Algorithmic Bioinformatics lab at [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html).
The labs belongs to both the [Mathematics and Informatics Faculty ("MI")](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/department-of-computer-science.html) and the [Center for Bioinformatics (ZBI)](https://zbi-www.bioinf.uni-sb.de/en) at [Saarland University and is part of Saarland Informatics Campus (SIC)](https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/en/).

The research focus will gradually shift more towards algorithm development and methodological research.
We look forward towards new exciting projects and collaborations, and we are also happy to continue and conclude ongoing projects at University Alliance Ruhr.
This website will remain the website of the lab, and the content will be gradually adapted towards the new profile.
