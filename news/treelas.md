Elias' and Sven's paper "Engineering Fused Lasso Solvers on Trees" was accepted at the 18th Symposium on Experimental Algorithms ([SEA 2020](http://www.sea2020.dmi.unict.it/)), which will be held as an online conference from June 16 till June 18.
Our paper presents two practically efficient algorithms for solving fused lasso problems on tree graphs with general weights for nodes and edges, even zero weights, which other algorithms cannot easily handle.

We hope to see you at SEA'20 for our presentation.
Also, the [treelas software](https://github.com/EQt/treelas) is avaliable on our [Software](/software) page.
