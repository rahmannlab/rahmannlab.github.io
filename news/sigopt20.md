Two researchers from the Genome Informatics group attended the [SIGOPT 2020](http://www.wiwi.tu-dortmund.de/wiwi/ms/en/sigopt/) meeting in Dortmund and presented their work on continous and combinatorial optimization problems in bioinformatics.

Elias presented his fast solver for the fused lasso problem on tree graphs (joint work with Sven).

Jens gave a talk about joint work with Henning and Sven, titled "Cost-optimal assignment of elements in genome-scale multi-way bucketed Cuckoo hash tables".

The bioinformatics session on Friday further included talks by David Blumenthal (Munich) on median graphs and by Sven Schrinner (DÃ¼sseldorf) on polyploid phasing.
