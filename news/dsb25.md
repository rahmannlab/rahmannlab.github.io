Jens and Johanna visited the workshop *Data Structures in Bioinformatics* in Pisa and presented their work on probabilistic filters.\
Jens gave a talk about *Blocked Bloom filters with Choices*. This approach improved the FPR of Blocked Bloom filters by a more balanced load per block.\
Johanna gave a talk about *Better Cuckoo filters*, introducing a windowed memory layout to increase the fill rate of Cuckoo filters.
