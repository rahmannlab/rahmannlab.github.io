We were having wonderful days at GCB 2024 in Bielefeld.
The group was very active:

- We organized a workshop on *Just-in-time compiled Python for bioinformatics research*.
- Sven co-organized the workshop on *Bioinformatics Education*, attempting to harmonize BSc curricula in Germany.
- Johanna presented a poster on the *unseen species estimation problem*.
- Jens gave a highly praised talk on efficiently computing strong vs. weak k-mers in large k-mer sets. We can mark weak k-mers in the human reference genome in 40 seconds.
- We also announced that we will host GCB in Saarbrücken in 2026.
