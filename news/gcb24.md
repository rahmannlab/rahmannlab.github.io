Wonderful days at GCB 2024 in Bielefeld.
The group is very active:

- We organized a workshop on *Just-in-time compiled Python for bioinformatics research*.
- Sven co-organized the workshop on *Bioinformatics Education*, attempting to harmonize BSc curricula in Germany.
- Johanna had a poster on the *unseen species estimation problem*
- Jens gave a talk on efficiently computing strong vs. weak k-mers in large k-mer sets.
- We also announced that we will host GCB in Saarbr√ºcken in 2026.
