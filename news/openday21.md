Saarland University Open House is taking place virtually on Satuday, June 26, 2021.
All departments offer insights into their research and provide information about their study programs.
We present a talk "**Genome assembly as a bioinformatics puzzle with billions of pieces**" for the interested public. There is also a real [puzzle to download](/talks/puzzle.pdf). Enjoy!
