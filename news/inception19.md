The third annual meeting of the [INCEPTION program](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/program_project/inception/) took place at Institut Pasteur in Paris on November 18 and 19. A distinguishing feature of this program is the tight collaboration between the life sciences and social sciences.
As a member of the scientific advisory board, Sven gave a talk about "reproducible genome-wide k-mer association studies".
