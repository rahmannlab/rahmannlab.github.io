During the winter semester, Prof. Sven Rahmann is offering the following courses:

* Lecture and tutorials in "Statistics, Probability and Applications in Bioinformatics". More information is on the [website](/lehre/spab), or directly in the [SIC CMS](https://cms.sic.saarland/spab), where you also need to **register** for the course with your UdS student account.

* Master Seminar "Current Topics in Sequence Analysis", for students who have previously passed the "Algorithms for Sequence Analysis course". More information is on the [website](/lehre/seminar), or directly in the [SIC Seminar System](https://seminars.cs.uni-saarland.de), where you choose your preferred seminar(s). Note that you need to go through the assignment process and cannot directly register for the seminar.
