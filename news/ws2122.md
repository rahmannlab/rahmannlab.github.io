Good news at the start of the semester:
The summer term lecture "Algorithms for Sequence Analysis" by Sven Rahmann received a Busy Beaver Award by the Student Council. This award is handed out for lectures that were well received and evaluated by its students.

During the winter semester, we are offering the following courses:

* Lecture and tutorials in "Statistics, Probability and Applications in Bioinformatics". More information is on the [website](/lehre/spab), or directly in the SIC CMS](https://cms.sic.saarland/spab), where you also need to **register** for the course with your UdS student account.
* Master Seminar "Current Topics in Sequence Analysis", for students who have previously passed the "Algorithms for Sequence Analysis course". More information is on the [website](/lehre/seminar), or directly in the [SIC Seminar System](https://seminars.cs.uni-saarland.de), where you choose your preferred seminar(s). Note that you need to go through the assignment process and cannot directly register for the seminar.
