The URL genomeinformatics.uni-due.de 
points to the public webspace of Sven's account
ht0884@staff.uni-duisburg-essen.de.
In the folder public_html/, we need a single file
index.php:

<?php
header("Location: https://rahmannlab.github.io/"); 
?>

This redirects genomeinformatics.uni-due.de to rahmannlab.github.io.


Next, to use www.rahmannlab.de as a custom domain for the website,
Sven must set CNAME entry of his domain at goneo to
rahmannlab.github.io
In addition, under settings in gitlab,
"custom domain" must be set to www.rahmannlab.de
(scroll far down!).
